# Politifact Web Scraping Project

## Overview

Unveiling the intricacies of political discourse, the Politifact Web Scraping Project is a Python-powered endeavor utilizing the Scrapy framework. This initiative seeks to extract and analyze fact-checking data from [Politifact.com](https://politifact.com), providing valuable insights into political statements, rulings, and the evolving information landscape.

## Key Features

1. **Data Extraction:** Scraps author names, saying dates, headlines, rulings, publishers, and article URLs for a comprehensive dataset.
2. **File Management:** Dynamically creates directories for organized storage of scraped data, ensuring a systematic approach from the project's outset.
3. **Image Downloads:** Utilizes Scrapy's image pipeline for downloading header images, enhancing the visual context of each article.
4. **Efficient CSV Handling:** Implements regular write intervals to prevent data loss and alleviate memory burden during asynchronous requests.
